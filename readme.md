# WIP: React + Vite Example App
> ### React + Vite codebase for creating a simple social media app that implements User authorization for Google APIs (with custom button)

For now, I mocked all data that will be needed for the backend, but will eventually plan to create it using nodejs or spring-boot

## Getting started

To get the app running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server (this project Vite)
